Robots for Android


Overview 

Robots is a turn-based game for Android devices. 

It is based on ROBOTS, an old BSD game. 

The objetive of the robots is only one: to kill you. 

The only thing you can do, is to try to escape from them. But use the teletransportation with care: you have only a few teletransport tickets! 

The robots will die if they collide between them or crash against something. 

That's your only opportunity to win the robots. 

Good luck! 


Technical notes 

Robots for Android has been developed with the Java language and the Android Studio IDE.
